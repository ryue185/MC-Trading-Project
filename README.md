# MC-Trading-Project
- This repository contains a group trading project I have done at the UChicago finance club Maroon Capital
- It is a simple pairs trading strategy with a twist, using Google and Netflix data and the tech ETF IYW's volatility
- Credits to Joseph Dey and Kirill Zhukov for their contribution to the original version of this
- Initially, the project contained many errors, and I personally reworked it after the semester wrapped up to correct all the errors, remove unnecessary parts and generally improve on the code
